Financial gain is more commonly associated with organized crime, blackmail with insider threats, and ethical with hacktivists."

Although this is a form of phishing, the more specific answer is the one you will need to choose on questions like this. Phishing uses social engineering techniques to succeed but is once again a broader answer than spear phishing and thus is not the correct choice. Finally, a Trojan horse pretends to be a legitimate or desirable program or file, which this scenario doesn\u2019t describe."

Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are less likely to prevent ransomware from being installed, and removing unnecessary software may reduce the attack surface but most ransomware is installed via attacks that leverage users."

      "explanation": "There are many indicators of compromise (IoCs), including unusual outbound network traffic, geographical irregularities like logins from a country where the person normally does not work, or increases in database read volumes beyond normal traffic patterns. Predictive analysis is analysis work done using datasets to attempt to determine trends and likely attack vectors so that analysts can focus their efforts where they will be most needed and effective. OSINT is open source intelligence, and threat maps are often real- time or near- real- time visualizations of where threats are coming from and where they are headed."

That likely means that the intruder has gained privileged access to the system, which should worry her even more! Reboots do not wipe audit.log, and Valerie should have permissions appropriate to perform her function. System errors could explain an empty audit.log, but are unlikely, and an empty log found during an investigation is a cause for concern."

DNS hijacking inserts false information into a DNS server, on- path (man- in- the- middle) attacks capture or modify traffic by causing the traffic to pass through a compromised midpoint, and zero- day attacks are unknown to product vendors and, therefore, no patches are available to correct them."
