Full- disk encryption is easier to deploy and manage but does not protect individual files in motion and does not effectively support multiuser scenarios. Partition- level encryption has the same challenges, albeit at a partition rather than full- disk level. Record- level encryption is typically used in databases to protect individual records or entries."
