Since this involves both scanning and OSINT gathering, this is reconnaissance instead of passive information gathering via OSINT. Known environment tests provide full information to testers, allowing them to use information about the environment without having to dis- cover it. Unknown environment tests simulate what an attacker would encounter and do not provide information; instead, the testers have to discover it themselves."
