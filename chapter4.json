IoC creation involves documenting and defining an indicator of compromise.

If an API key is lost or stolen, the key can be invalidated and reissued, and since API keys can be matched to usage, Cynthia\u2019s company can also bill customers based on their usage patterns if they want to. A firewall or IP restrictions may be able to help, but they can be fragile; customer IP addresses may change.

Agentless NAC uses scanning and/or network inventory techniques and will typically not have as deep a level of insight into the configuration and software versions running on a system. Postadmission systems make enforcement decisions based on what users do after they gain admission to a network, rather than prior to gaining admission, allowing you to quickly rule out two of these options."

Password length and complexity don\u2019t matter if the password was compromised elsewhere, and minimum age policies are used to prevent reuse in the organization by resetting passwords over and over again to return to an original desired password.
