      "explanation": "Organizations set recovery point objectives (RPOs) which describe how much data is acceptable to lose in a data loss event, and recovery time objectives (RTOs), which describe the maximum amount of time that it should take to recover data. Together these two objectives help guide backup strategy and infrastructure design and implementation. MTBF (mean time before failure) describes the mean time before a device like a hard drive, power supply, or network switch will fail, typically described in hours of powered- on operation. RFBT was made up for this question."

A false negative is when the IDS mistakes an attack for legitimate traffic. It is the opposite of a false positive. Options C and D are both incorrect.

A hot site is a fully functional environment with all the hardware, software, and data needed to operate an organization. They are expensive to maintain and run but are used by organizations that cannot take the risk of downtime. A cold site is a location that can be brought online but does not have systems; cold sites typically have access to power and bandwidth but need to be fully equipped to operate after a disaster since they are just rented space. An RTO is a recovery time objective, and it measures how long it should take to resume operations; it is not a type of disaster recovery site."

Setting a default password means that a common password will be known.

This will provide a warning that someone\u2019s account is being used when they are not actually using it. Host- based antivirus/antimalware is almost never a bad idea, but this scenario did not indicate that the compromise was due to malware, so antimalware may not address the threat. Since the engineer has access to the SCADA system, a network intrusion prevention system (NIPS) is unlikely to block them from accessing the system, and full- disk encryption (FDE) will not mitigate this threat because the system is live and running, meaning that the disk will be decrypted in use."

A cold site is a location that can be brought online but does not have systems; cold sites typically have access to power and bandwidth, but they need to be fully equipped to operate after a disaster since they are just rented space. Warm sites have some or all of the infrastructure and systems Nora needs but does not have data. A hot site is a fully functional environment with all of the hardware, software, and data needed to operate an organization.

Source IP hashing uses a hash of the source and destination IP addresses to determine which server receives the connection. This also allows for interrupted sessions to go to the same server. Resourcebased load balancing takes into account the availability of resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth for a server. Round- robin load balancing simply distributes connections as they come in by moving through a list of servers."

Masking replaces information with other data like asterisks or X\u2019s when displayed, allowing partial data to be displayed for business purposes. Tokenization replaces data with an alternate value, often based on a hashing algorithm that allows the alternate value to be used as an index or reference without the actual data visible."
